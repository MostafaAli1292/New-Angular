<p><span data-contrast="none">1.1 OVERVIEW Our Services may include text, data, graphics, images, or other content (collectively, "Content") created by us or third parties, including health care providers and partners such as physicians, hospitals, polyclinics, laboratories, scan centers and pharmacies.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:375,&quot;335559737&quot;:375,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">1.2 OUR SERVICES Our services include this Site and an application which allows users to book healthcare providers including clinics, hospitals, or diagnostic labs for physical consultations. Our Public and Protected Services are collectively referred to as the "Services". In other words, our Services are only intended to help you search and book an appointment with a Provider. You acknowledge that some of the Services are made available under various names. You also acknowledge that the Services may be made available under (i) certain Salamtak subsidiaries and affiliates or (ii) independent Providers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:375,&quot;335559737&quot;:375,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">1.2.1 Public Services We make some Services available without registering or obtaining a password. We call these "Public Services." You may make personal, non-commercial use of the Public Services so long as you comply with these Terms. These Services include directories ("Directories") for physicians, medical consultants, and laboratory and scan centers' branches, collectively ("Providers"). The Directories are provided for your convenience. The Directories only include Providers who use our Services and who have chosen to participate in the Directories. The listing of a Provider within the Directories does not constitute a recommendation for the services of such Provider or a warranty of the certifications or qualifications of such Provider. As all information is relayed as submitted by the Providers, and while we make reasonable efforts to provide you with accurate content, we do not guarantee, represent, nor warrant, whether expressed or implied, the accuracy of any information with respect to professional qualifications, expertise, quality of work, price or cost information, insurance, or any other content available through the services. In no event shall we be liable to you or anyone else for any decision made or action taken by you in reliance on any such content. We do not in any way endorse or recommend any individual or entity listed or accessible through the services. While bookings may be made through our site, we cannot guarantee the availability of the relevant Provider, nor can we foresee appointment cancellations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:750,&quot;335559737&quot;:750,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">1.2.2 Protected Services Some of our Services are protected by technical measures intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of sensitive information our Users store and share using our Services. We call these "Protected Services." One such safeguard is requiring each User to be properly authenticated by means of authorization ("Credentials"), such as unique identifiers, usernames, passwords, and the like. In order to obtain Credentials, you must provide certain information about yourself. If you are registering for a Protected Service, or accessing or using, or attempting to access or use, a Protected Service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, someone other than yourself - such as any of your family members (each, a "Principal") - you must also identify and provide information about each Principal. Further terms and conditions related to User Registration are highlighted in Section 6. These Protected Services are all Services that build you a personal Medical Record ("Medical Record"), such as receiving your medical information and results from Providers like laboratories, scan centers and physicians' accounts. This data is completely private and secured and we hereby guarantee so. You are the owner of the data and by clicking "I agree", you give the Providers the right to send you the information through your private account on the Site. In order to help you build your own electronic Medical Record, you may agree to send a copy of this data to the supplier doctor through our Services, which will be protected and kept private as well and cannot be shared with third parties. The supplier doctor will keep it under your name on his account for building your Medical Record at the clinic. In case you do not agree to keep a Medical Record of your data, you can send Salamtak your request expressing your desire not to share, and Salamtak shall comply with this request.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:750,&quot;335559737&quot;:750,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">1.3 CONTENT Our Services allow you to access reviews and other forums where various Users can share information, opinions, ratings and other Content. We generally do not pre-screen or monitor submitted Content, and such Content may simply represent a user's opinion. Our Services may also include survey results, ratings or testimonials ("Evaluations") from users that may endorse, recommend, critique, analyze, evaluate or otherwise describe the Providers and the nature or quality of the Services received by such user. Such Evaluations are anecdotal first-hand accounts of individual Users, and do not constitute neither a Provider's judgment nor the product of medical science. You should understand that the Evaluations expressed therein are of those who provide the same, that it does not reflect the opinions of Salamtak, and does not in any way constitute or imply our endorsement or recommendation thereof. Thus, Salamtak shall not assume any liability for any of the posted Evaluations. Further, you should bear in mind that Evaluations are subject to errors and biases that are common in anecdotal first- hand accounts, and should not to be presumed to be reliable or error-free. Any Content that you obtain or receive from Salamtak, its employees, contractors, partners, sponsors, advertisers, licensors or otherwise through the Services, is for informational, scheduling and payment purposes only. All information is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. The information offered on the Site is not a substitute for medical advice from qualified healthcare professionals. If you rely on any Content, including reviews, you do so solely at your own risk. We encourage you to independently confirm any Content relevant to you with other sources, including the Healthcare Provider's office, medical associations relevant to the applicable specialty, your state medical boards, and the appropriate licensing or certification authorities to verify listed credentials and education.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:375,&quot;335559737&quot;:375,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
